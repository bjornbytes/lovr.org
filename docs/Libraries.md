Libraries
===

Libraries are external packages that you can import and use in your projects.  Some libraries extend
the capabilities of LÖVR and others just make it easier to get stuff done.  Libraries are usually
distributed as a single Lua file.  You can copy the Lua file into your project and `require` it to
use the library:

```
-- library.lua is sitting next to our main.lua here
local lib = require('library')

function lovr.load()
  lib.doStuff()
end
```

Below is a catalog of useful libraries.  All of them can be used with LÖVR, although some of them
only depend on Lua and aren't specific to LÖVR.
